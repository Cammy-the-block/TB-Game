TB_Game also known as Text Based Game is a basic old school collection of text based programs and games I have developed. It includes Gangup, Black Jack, an encryption and decryption program, and Alchemy.

---------Various Programs---------
	------ Gangup ------ WIP
		Gangup is tic tack toe with four players trying to get four in a row. The matrix starts out with only zeros. A player 			will enter the coordinates of there next move. If there are no errors the game will continue in the manner until a 		player has gotten four pieces in a row. Currently players are only able to make moves, there is no win checking.
		---To Do List ---
			*Add Win Checking
			*Make a non text based version to in this text based collection of games.
	
	------ Black Jack ------
		Classic Black Jack. Has not been started.
		
	------ Encryption and Decryption ------
		A basic encryption and decryption program with to separate keys per encrypt/decrypt. Probably not very strong.
		---To Do list ---
			*Configure to use one key instead of two
			*Auto key generator
			*Support for longer keys
			*Test strength of encryption
			
	------ Alchemy ------ WIP
		A simple text based game where you add elements together to make new elements. Elements are configurable.
		---To Do List ---
			*Change elements from a few different letters and numbers to actual elements that make sense
